## A basic search bar fetching data from YouTube's API.
It's a tiny project which may be considered as the top of a previous one. 
Both are taken from Modern React with Redux course. Hats off to Stephen 
Grider.

### Changes
A bit of refactoring code. Trying out to implement a custom hook. Hooray, it 
worked eventually!

### Getting Started
Mind while pushing files into a repository I received a complaint sent by A Big 
Brother. It was absolutely furious at the fact that my API had 
been shared to public. For the reason I had to take it down. I expect you're 
able to go to your Google Dashboard and create a new YouTube Data API on your own.
